Question: What's the number of total death in Malaysia?
Line number: from line 6 to line 7
Discussion: The answer to the question above is 91. 
                   This is what i expected to be. 
                   I used the code "covid_data.loc[covid_data.loc[:,"location"]=="Malaysia","total_cases"]" to find out the result.
